# React Starter

This starter kit is designed to get you up and running with a bunch of awesome new front-end technologies, all on top of a configurable, feature-rich webpack build system that's already setup to provide hot reloading, CSS preprocessing with Sass, unit testing, code coverage reports, bundle splitting, and more.

The primary goal of this project is to remain as **unopinionated** as possible. Its purpose is not to dictate your project structure or to demonstrate a complete sample application, but to provide a set of tools intended to make front-end development robust, easy, and, most importantly, fun. Check out the full feature list below!

## Getting Started

After confirming that your development environment meets the specified [requirements](#requirements), you can create a new project based on `react starter` by doing the following:

### Install from source

First, clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ranjithprabhuk/react-starter.git <your-project-name>
$ cd <your-project-name>
```

Then install dependencies by executing the following commands

```bash
$ npm install    # Install project dependencies
$ npm start      # Compile and launch app in http://localhost:5001 [production environment]
```

While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `npm start`; however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:

|`npm run <script>`|Description|
|------------------|-----------|
|`start`|Serves your app at `localhost:5001`. Production Build of your Application|
|`compile`|Compiles the application to local folder (dev) using webpack|
|`dev`|Compiles the application and runs at `localhost:5000` and src code changes are watched |
|`build`|Make a production build and files are stored in dist folder|
|`test-watch`|Runs Mocha and watches for changes to re-run tests; does not generate coverage reports.|
|`test`|Runs Mocha and check for all the test cases.|
